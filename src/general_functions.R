#' calculate variance explained of glm, calculated on the response scale
#' 
#' @description I created this fun to work for glm's fit woth a gaussian
#' family but a non-identity link, it won't make sense for all GLMS

#' @param mod glm object
#'
#' @return R squared

  # well the model fit on the response scale (i.e. this wouldn't make
  # sense for many types of GLMS)
